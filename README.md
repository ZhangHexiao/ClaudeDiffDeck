# DiffDeck

> Review every file change Claude Code makes — with diffs, risk flags, and one-click git workflows.

DiffDeck watches your Claude Code sessions and surfaces every file modification as a reviewable diff card in a sidebar panel. See what changed, why it changed, flag risky modifications, and ship with confidence — all without leaving VS Code.

## Features

### Change Review

- **Automatic detection** — Hooks into Claude Code's `Stop` event to capture every `Edit`, `Write`, and `MultiEdit` operation
- **Diff cards** — Each modified file appears as a collapsible card with a unified diff view
- **Risk badges** — Files are flagged as HIGH / MED / LOW risk based on built-in rules (sensitive config files, large deletions, etc.) and your own custom glob patterns
- **AI explanations** — Each card includes an explanation extracted from Claude's response, so you know *why* a change was made
- **User prompt tracking** — Every turn shows the original prompt you gave Claude, making it easy to trace intent
- **Confirm / Reject** — Confirm marks a change as reviewed; Reject marks it *and* opens VS Code's built-in diff editor so you can selectively revert lines

### Git Workflows

![Git workflow buttons — Start, Save to Remote, Re-request Review](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZhangHexiao/ClaudeDiffDeck/main/media/screenshot-workflows.png)

Three buttons at the bottom of the panel automate common git tasks:

| Button | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Start** | Prompts you to describe your task (any language). Infers the branch type (`feat`/`fix`/`refactor`/…), generates a branch name like `feat/260405-add-login-page`, checks out from latest `main`, pushes, and opens a draft PR. |
| **Save to Remote** | Checks you're not on `main`/`test`, analyzes changes, auto-splits commits by directory when needed, generates conventional commit messages, and pushes. Handles upstream setup and rebase automatically. |
| **Re-request Review** | Pushes latest commits. If the PR is still a draft, marks it as ready. If it's already open, finds all previous reviewers and re-requests their review. |

### Activity History

Every action — change reviews, git workflows, errors — is logged in the same timeline so you have a full audit trail of your session.

## Prerequisites

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 1.85+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and working in your terminal
- [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) — required for the **Start** and **Re-request Review** buttons
  - Run `gh auth login` once to authenticate

## Installation

### From source (development)

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd claude_extension
npm install
npm run build
```

Then open the project in VS Code and press **F5** to launch the Extension Development Host.

### From .vsix

```bash
npm run package
code --install-extension diffdeck-0.0.1.vsix
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Install the hook

Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run:

```
DiffDeck: Install Hook
```

This writes a `Stop` hook entry into your project's `.claude/settings.json` and creates the `.claude/pending-review/` directory. You only need to do this once per project.

### 2. Run Claude Code

Open a terminal in VS Code and run `claude` as you normally would. Ask it to make changes to your code.

### 3. Review changes

When Claude finishes its turn, the hook fires and DiffDeck displays all modifications in the sidebar. For each file you'll see:

- A **risk badge** (HIGH / MED / LOW)
- The **change type** (edit, write, create, etc.)
- **+N / -N** line counts
- An **explanation** from Claude's response
- A collapsible **unified diff**
- **Confirm** and **Reject** buttons

Click a card header to expand it. Click **Reject** to open the file in VS Code's diff editor where you can selectively undo changes.

### 4. Use git workflows

Use the three buttons at the bottom of the panel:

1. **Start** — Begin a new task. Describe what you want to do, and DiffDeck creates a properly named branch and draft PR.
2. **Save to Remote** — When you're happy with the changes, commit and push in one click.
3. **Re-request Review** — After addressing review feedback, push and re-notify reviewers.

## Configuration

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `diffDeck.riskyGlobs` | `string[]` | `[]` | Additional glob patterns to flag as high risk (e.g. `"src/secrets/**"`) |
| `diffDeck.largeDeletionThreshold` | `number` | `50` | Files with more deleted lines than this are flagged as high risk |

### Built-in risk patterns

The following file patterns are flagged as high risk by default:

```
**/.env*          **/package.json       **/package-lock.json
**/yarn.lock      **/pnpm-lock.yaml     **/*.config.{js,ts,json,mjs,cjs}
**/.github/workflows/**                 **/Dockerfile
**/docker-compose*.yml                  **/tsconfig*.json
**/webpack.config.*                     **/vite.config.*
**/next.config.*
```

Additional rules:
- File deleted → HIGH
- More than 50 lines deleted (configurable) → HIGH
- New file at repository root → MEDIUM

## Commands

All commands are available via the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`):

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `DiffDeck: Install Hook` | Install the Claude Code Stop hook in the current workspace |
| `DiffDeck: Start (Branch + Draft PR)` | Create a new branch and draft PR |
| `DiffDeck: Save to Remote` | Auto-commit and push |
| `DiffDeck: Re-request Review` | Push and request review |
| `DiffDeck: Clear All` | Clear all review cards and activity history |
| `DiffDeck: Refresh` | Re-scan the pending review directory |
| `DiffDeck: Move to Right Sidebar` | Move the panel to VS Code's secondary sidebar |

## How It Works

```
Claude Code (terminal)
  │  Stop hook fires at end of turn
  ▼
hooks/stop-hook.js
  │  Reads transcript JSONL
  │  Extracts Edit/Write/MultiEdit tool calls
  │  Reconstructs before/after content
  │  Writes JSON to .claude/pending-review/
  ▼
DiffDeck extension
  │  FileSystemWatcher detects new JSON
  │  Enriches with diff, risk assessment, explanations
  │  Renders in sidebar webview
  ▼
You review, confirm/reject, then ship
```

## Tips

- The panel docks to the **right sidebar** (Secondary Side Bar) automatically on first activation. Drag it or run `DiffDeck: Move to Right Sidebar` to reposition.
- **Reject** opens VS Code's native diff editor — you can edit the right side directly and save to keep only the parts you want.
- Activity history (workflow logs) persists for the current session. Use **Clear** to reset.
- The **Save to Remote** button auto-splits commits by directory when you have changes across multiple areas of the codebase.
